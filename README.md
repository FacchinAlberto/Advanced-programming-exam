In this repository there are all the files needed to complete the project for the advanced programming exam that I took.
It was divided in two parts:
- the first one was about the creation of a program capable of drawing the Mandelbrot fractal as a color image in greyscale netpbm format;
- the second, instead, was about the implementation of a sort fo real programming language, which allows the user to allocate variables and arrays, make agebraic operations, use boolean operators, cicles and if conditions. It is based on the evaluation of all the expressions taken in input.

Just the expr.py file concerns the second part, all the others are related to the first.
